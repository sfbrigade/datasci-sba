# Tips and Tricks

## Working with Git and GitHub
Working with Git and GitHub might seem tricky at first, but I promise it gets much easier as you gain experience with it! Here are some basic instructions, but please feel free to ping the #datasci-sba channel if you need help.

[Clone this repo locally](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-sba.git
$ cd datasci-sba
```
Create your own branch to start work:
```
$ git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```
To change between branches: 
```
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```
Do some work:  
```
$ vim <some-files>
```
When you're ready, commit, [merge any upstream changes](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/), [deal with conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/), and push your branch
```
$ git add <edited-files>
$ git commit -m 'my awesome feature'
$ git push
```
[Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your pushed branch (compare branch) to the master branch

Another handy thing while working in terminal is to automatically show what branch you're working on in the command line. To do this, add the following your your `.bash_profile`

```
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

## Using the Jupyter Notebook
To access the Jupyter notebook, type ```$ jupyter notebook``` on Mac or ```$ jupyter notebook --no-browser``` on Windows. It will say "The Jupyter terminal is running at http://localhost:8888/sometoken." Copy the link and paste it in your browser. 

If you have a Windows computer, you may see an error message about a "dead kernel." [The fix](http://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/bash-and-ipython-on-ubuntu-for-windows.html) is to type in Bash the following: ```$ conda install -c jzuhone zeromq=4.1.dev0```.
