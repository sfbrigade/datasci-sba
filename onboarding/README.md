# What is the SBA project about?

## Context 
This project is focused on working with San Francisco area Small Business Administration (SBA) data in the hopes of rendering trends in the use of small business loans visible in order to assist in the administration of San Feancisco-area loans and answer questions like:
- How actively are different communities or areas taking advantage of available loans? Are there areas that could benefit from learning about SBA resources?
- What are some success stories among SBA loan recipients that can help the the SBA garner more support - and benefit more small businesses?
